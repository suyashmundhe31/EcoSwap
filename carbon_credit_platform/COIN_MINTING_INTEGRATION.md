# Coin Minting Integration Implementation

## Overview
This implementation connects the coin minting process to the marketplace credits database, ensuring that all minted coins are properly stored and can be tracked, verified, and traded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Solar Panel Minting Integration (`app/api/v1/solar_panel.py`)

**Modified Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/solar-panel/mint-carbon-coins`

**New Features:**
- Added user authentication using `get_current_user` dependency
- Added required parameters: `issuer_name`, `description`, `price_per_coin`
- Integrated with `MarketplaceService` to create marketplace credit entries
- Returns marketplace credit ID and verification status

**New Parameters:**
- `issuer_name` (required): Name of the credit issuer
- `description` (optional): Description of the carbon credits
- `price_per_coin` (optional): Price per carbon coin

**Response Enhancement:**
- Added `marketplace_credit_id` to response
- Added `marketplace_info` section with verification status
- Updated success message to indicate database storage

### 2. Forestation Minting Integration (`app/api/v1/forestation.py`)

**New Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/forestation/applications/{application_id}/mint-coins`

**Features:**
- Requires application to be approved before minting
- Calculates carbon credits using forest analysis
- Creates marketplace credit entries automatically
- Links to source forestation application via `source_project_id`

**Parameters:**
- `issuer_name` (required): Name of the credit issuer
- `description` (optional): Description of the forestation project
- `price_per_coin` (optional): Price per carbon coin

### 3. Forestation Service Enhancement (`app/services/forestation_service.py`)

**Modified Method:** `calculate_carbon_credits()`

**New Features:**
- Automatically creates marketplace credits after carbon credit calculation
- Links forestation applications to marketplace credits
- Extracts carbon coin amounts from analysis results
- Updates response with marketplace credit information

### 4. Frontend Updates

**Updated Files:**
- `src/services/solarPanelApi.js`: Added new parameters to minting request
- `src/components/marketplace/CarbonCoinMintingSuccess.jsx`: Updated minting data structure

**New Fields Added:**
- `issuer_name`: Defaults to "Solar Panel Owner"
- `description`: Auto-generated based on energy production
- `price_per_coin`: Defaults to $15.0

## Database Integration

### Marketplace Credits Table
All minted coins are now stored in the `marketplace_credits` table with:

- **Solar Panel Credits:**
  - `source_type`: "solar_panel"
  - `source_project_id`: null (can be linked to solar applications if needed)
  - `coins_issued`: Annual CO2 avoided tonnes
  - `verification_status`: "pending" (requires manual verification)

- **Forestation Credits:**
  - `source_type`: "forestation"
  - `source_project_id`: Links to forestation application ID
  - `coins_issued`: Calculated from forest analysis
  - `verification_status`: "pending" (requires manual verification)

## API Endpoints for Verification

### Get All Minted Coins
```
GET /api/v1/coins/
GET /api/v1/marketplace/credits
```

### Get Coin Statistics
```
GET /api/v1/coins/stats
GET /api/v1/marketplace/summary
```

### Filter by Source Type
```
GET /api/v1/coins/solar
GET /api/v1/coins/forestation
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created: `test_coin_minting_integration.py`

**Test Coverage:**
- Solar panel coin minting and database storage
- Forestation application creation, approval, and coin minting
- Marketplace credits API functionality
- Coins API statistics

**To Run Tests:**
```bash
cd carbon_credit_platform
python test_coin_minting_integration.py
```

## Verification Workflow

1. **Coin Minting:** Coins are minted with "pending" verification status
2. **Manual Verification:** Admin reviews and verifies credits
3. **Marketplace Listing:** Verified credits become available for trading
4. **Trading:** Users can buy/sell verified carbon credits

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Traceability:** All minted coins are tracked in the database
✅ **Verification System:** Credits require verification before trading
✅ **Source Linking:** Forestation credits link back to original applications
✅ **Marketplace Integration:** Seamless integration with trading platform
✅ **Statistics & Analytics:** Comprehensive coin tracking and reporting
✅ **User Authentication:** Proper user identification for all minting operations

## Next Steps

1. **Admin Verification Interface:** Create UI for admins to verify credits
2. **Automated Verification:** Implement rules-based auto-verification for certain criteria
3. **Price Discovery:** Add dynamic pricing based on market conditions
4. **Trading Integration:** Connect verified credits to trading functionality
5. **Blockchain Integration:** Consider blockchain tokenization for verified credits
